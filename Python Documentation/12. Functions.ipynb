This alows us to create more complex Python scripts and use up less resources, as well as speed up the coding process. It's the cornerstone of the Don't Repeat Yourself style of programming.\n\n## Creating Functions \n\nThey are created using <code>def</code>, followed by the name of the funciton and the inputs, called arguments, called up. It's best to avoid using the same name as possible built-in Python functions. Same as with loops, the function has to be indented. It's common practice to then use comments and doctrings in order to expalin the function.\n\nFunctions are usually created at the start of a notebook so that they can be used throughout.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Function that spams multiple times\n\ndef spam():\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')\n    print('Spam')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T06:30:54.760498Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T06:30:54.760853Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T06:30:54.783947Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T06:30:54.760752Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T06:30:54.783013Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Using the function\n\nspam()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T06:30:59.121417Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T06:30:59.122117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T06:30:59.127469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T06:30:59.122064Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T06:30:59.126889Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Spam\nSpam\nSpam\nSpam\nSpam\nSpam\nSpam\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Function that writes 'Hello world'\n\ndef hello_world():\n    print('Hello World!')\n\nhello_world()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T06:31:01.656033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T06:31:01.656790Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T06:31:01.661736Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T06:31:01.656754Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T06:31:01.660606Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Hello World!\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Arguments (Parameters)\n\nWhile functions can be simple as shown above, advance functions might require additional arguments which are defined in the parantheses.
